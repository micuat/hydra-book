Preface
========

[Hydra](https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/) is an analog-synth-like coding environment for real-time visuals. It is created by Olivia Jack and is [open-source](https://github.com/ojack/hydra); thus, you can either open the browser version or clone the repository to serve it on your computer. There are a few resources:

* [The official documentation](https://github.com/ojack/hydra#Getting-Started) is a good resource to get started,
* [Function list](https://github.com/ojack/hydra/blob/master/docs/funcs.md) covers all the functions available in Hydra,
* and [Hydra Patterns on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hydra_patterns) is a way to get inspirations from other artists.

This article is a work-in-progress online book to collect Hydra snippets. The goal is not only to accumulate frequently-used techniques to make coding easier but also to research the theory of Hydra to discover new images.
